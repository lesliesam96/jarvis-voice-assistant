# JARVIS AI Voice Assistant System — Project Draft

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** JARVIS AI Voice Assistant System  
**Author:** Leslie  
**Type:** Desktop AI Voice Assistant + Web-Based Multilingual AI Assistant  
**Language:** Python 3.x  
**Status:** Active Development  

The JARVIS AI Voice Assistant System is an intelligent, voice-controlled personal assistant inspired by the iconic JARVIS from Iron Man. The project consists of **two independent modules** that demonstrate different approaches to building AI-powered voice assistants:

1. **JARVIS CLI Voice Assistant** — A command-line voice assistant that listens to spoken commands and performs tasks like opening applications, playing music, searching Wikipedia, and more.
2. **Multilingual AI Assistant** — A web-based assistant powered by Google Gemini AI with a Streamlit frontend, capable of understanding natural language queries and responding with AI-generated answers in both text and audio.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Build a fully functional voice-controlled personal assistant using Python.
- Demonstrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities using industry-standard libraries.
- Integrate external AI (Google Gemini) for intelligent, context-aware responses.
- Provide a user-friendly web interface via Streamlit for broader accessibility.
- Implement structured logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Showcase modular Python project design across CLI and web paradigms.

## 5. Module Details

### 5.1 Module 1 — JARVIS CLI Voice Assistant

#### Execution Flow

1. Application starts → `wish_me()` greets the user based on the time of day.
2. Enters an infinite loop → Listens for voice commands via `takeCommand()`.
3. Matches the command to a handler → Executes the corresponding action.
4. Responds via `speak()` (pyttsx3 text-to-speech).
5. Repeats until the user says `"exit"`.

### 5.2 Module 2 — Multilingual AI Assistant

**Entry Point:** `Multilingual AI Assistant/main.py`  
**Interface:** Web browser (Streamlit)  
**AI Engine:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash  
**Voice Engine:** gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

#### Features

- **Voice Input:** Captures user speech via microphone using SpeechRecognition.
- **AI-Powered Responses:** Sends the transcribed text to Google Gemini for intelligent, natural language responses.
- **Text Display:** Shows the AI-generated response in a scrollable text area.
- **Audio Playback:** Converts the response to speech (MP3) and plays it in the browser.
- **Audio Download:** Provides a download button for the generated speech file.

#### Execution Flow

1. User opens the Streamlit web app in a browser.
2. Clicks the **"Ask me anything!"** button.
3. The app listens for voice input via the microphone.
4. Transcribed text is sent to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for processing.
5. The AI response is displayed as text and converted to audio via gTTS.
6. Audio is played in-browser with an option to download the MP3 file.

## 7. Installation & Setup

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd JARVIS-System

# Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install dependencies for Module 1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Run Module 1 — JARVIS CLI Assistant
python main.py

# Step 5: Install dependencies for Module 2
pip install -r "Multilingual AI Assistant/requirements.txt"

# Step 6: Run Module 2 — Multilingual AI Assistant
streamlit run "Multilingual AI Assistant/main.py"
```

> **Note:** You need a valid Google Gemini API key configured in the Module 2 source code for AI responses to work.

## 8. Logging

Both modules implement structured logging using Python's built-in `logging` module:

- **Log Directory:** `logs/`
- **Log File:** `application.log`
- **Format:** `[ %(asctime)s ] %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`
- **Level:** `INFO`

Logs capture speech recognition errors, exceptions, and application events for debugging and monitoring.

## 9. Key Learning Outcomes

- **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language to text using Google Speech API.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converting text responses to spoken audio (pyttsx3 offline, gTTS online).
- **AI Integration:** Leveraging Google Gemini LLM for intelligent conversational responses.
- **Web App Development:** Building interactive web interfaces with Streamlit.
- **System Automation:** Controlling OS-level applications via subprocess.
- **API Integration:** Working with Wikipedia and Google APIs.
- **Logging & Debugging:** Implementing structured application logging.
- **Modular Design:** Organizing a project into independent, self-contained modules.
